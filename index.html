    <p><em>Common Inquiry (CI)</em> is an artist collective founded in 2023 in New York City, based on shared interest and passion for public spaces and the commons. Common Inquiry seeks to contribute to advancing the collective knowledge and stewardship of public spaces by:</p>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>developing and implementing art and design projects across New York City. These projects serve as a complementing approach to its research and practice, aiming to (re)activate public spaces and enhance the capacity of public spaces as shared commons.
            <ul>
                <li>Currently we are working on Lost & Found, a multimedia storytelling project to chronicle the tales of MTA riders in New York City through site-specific installation. This project recognizes the significance of personal narratives in shaping the collective urban experience. Beyond documentation, the project aims to cultivate a sense of ownership toward urban surroundings, inspire appreciation for often-overlooked urban details, and co-develop new narratives that capture the essence of urban life. To submit your Lost & Found story, please send us a note. </li>
